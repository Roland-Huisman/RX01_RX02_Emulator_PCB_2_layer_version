# RX01_RX02_Emulator_PCB_2_layer_version

This is a 2 layer redesign of the PCB for the RX01 / RX02 Emulator designed by Don North.

The original design and the software are in the original repository of Don North:
https://github.com/AK6DN/rx02_emulator


I've made this redesign to reduce the costs of these boards.
